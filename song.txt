Like a moth to a flame
Ill pull you in, Ill pull you back to
What you need initially
Its just one call away 
And youll leave him, youre loyal to me
But this time, I'll let you be

'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true
